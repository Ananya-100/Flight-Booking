## Flight Booking

This project is focused on the Quality Assurance (QA) testing of a Flight Booking System web application. The goal is to evaluate the stability and correctness of core features like login, flight search, booking, and customer enquiry.

Some features passed as expected, while others failed due to existing bugs in the application.
